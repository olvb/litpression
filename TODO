- only one triangulation per frame
- use triangle's listoftriangles to delete strokes part of triangles too small
- investigate if better performance can be reached by detecting useless strokes while moving strokes
- ignore gradiant with low magnitude and interpolate neighboring gradients to provide better stroke orientation
- smarter depth ordering. randomize new strokes positions, maybe put thick strokes deeper
